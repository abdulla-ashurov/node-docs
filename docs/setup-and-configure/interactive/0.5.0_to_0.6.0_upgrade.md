# Overview

This document is providing the information and instructions mostly for operators for how to make an upgrade process with new installation approach.

We decided to get rid of debian package as an installtion artifact and use our own installation tool. The main reason why is to help our current and future operators to join to our network or make upgrade steps in a simplier way, without a lot of additional command/steps.

For this upgrade from `0.5.0` to `0.6.0` version there are 2 possible scenario:

- upgrade with installing Cosmovisor
- upgrade only `cheqd-noded` binary.

[Cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/run-node/cosmovisor.html) is a tool from `cosmos-sdk` team which is able to make an upgrade in a full-auto mode. It can download and exchange binary without any actions from operator. Starting from `0.6.0` version we assume to use Csomovisor as a tool for handling our upgrade process.

For more information about interactive installer there is a [documentation](./interactive-installer.md).
Here only answers for installer's questions will be provided.

## Upgrade with installing Cosmovisor

Cause installation and setting up the Cosmovisor is tricky and requires some additional steps for setting up the `systemd` service we injected all this steps into our interactive installer.
The flow for installtion is:

### Stop the `systemd` service

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cheqd-noded
```

and make sure that it was really stopped by:

```bash
systemctl status cheqd-noded
```

Output should be like:

```text
● cheqd-noded.service - Service for running cheqd-node daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cheqd-noded.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: inactive (dead) since Thu 2022-07-07 12:31:12 UTC; 27s ago
       Docs: https://docs.cheqd.io/node
    Process: 13427 ExecStart=/usr/bin/cheqd-noded start (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 13427 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
```

the main focus here: `Active: inactive (dead)`

### Remove current debian package

```bash
sudo apt remove cheqd-node
```

### Download interactive installer and run it

```bash
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/v0.6.0/installer/installer.py
sudo python3 installer.py
```

### The next answers are needed for upgrading `cheqd-noded` binary with Cosmovisor installation

**IMPORTANT** For running an `Upgrade scenario` it's required to setup current home directory for `cheqd` user as an answer on question `Set path for cheqd user's home directory [default: /home/cheqd]:`. Cause only if this directory exists upgrade scenario will be used.

```text
1) v0.5.0
2) v0.6.0
3) v0.6.0-rc2
4) v0.6.0-rc1
5) v0.5.0-rc2
Choose list option number above to select version of cheqd-node to install [default: 1]:

Set path for cheqd user's home directory [default: /home/cheqd]:

Existing cheqd-node configuration folder detected. Do you want to upgrade an existing cheqd-node installation? (yes/no) [default: no]:
y
*********  INFO: Installing cheqd-node with Cosmovisor allows for automatic unattended upgrades for valid software upgrade proposals.
Install cheqd-noded using Cosmovisor? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
y
Overwrite existing configuration for cheqd-node logging? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
y
Overwrite existing configuration for logrotate? (yes/no) [default: yes]:
y
```

**WARNING** Please make sure that you answered `yes` for questions about overwriting existing configuration. It's very important for making new installation with Cosmovisor.

### Start new `systemd` service

```bash
sudo systemctl start cheqd-cosmovisor
```

## Upgrade only binary

In case of just updating current installation the next steps can make it:

### Stop the `systemd` service

```bash
sudo systemctl stop cheqd-noded
```

and make sure that it was really stopped by:

```bash
systemctl status cheqd-noded
```

Output should be like:

```text
● cheqd-noded.service - Service for running cheqd-node daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/cheqd-noded.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

### Remove current debian package

```bash
sudo apt remove cheqd-node
```

### Download interactive installer and run it

```bash
wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheqd/cheqd-node/v0.6.0/installer/installer.py
sudo python3 installer.py
```

### Answers for interactive installer

**IMPORTANT** For running an `Upgrade scenario` it's required to setup current home directory for `cheqd` user as an answer on question `Set path for cheqd user's home directory [default: /home/cheqd]:`. Cause only if this directory exists upgrade scenario will be used.

```text

2) v0.6.0
3) v0.6.0-rc2
4) v0.6.0-rc1
5) v0.5.0-rc2
Choose list option number above to select version of cheqd-node to install [default: 1]:

Set path for cheqd user's home directory [default: /home/cheqd]:

Existing cheqd-node configuration folder detected. Do you want to upgrade an existing cheqd-node installation? (yes/no) [default: no]:

```

**WARNING**. In case of keeping just standalone `cheqd-noded` without Cosmovisor it's significant to keep your `systemd` service files without overwriting. Please make sure that your answers were `no`.

### As was previously, for starting the service only the next command is needed

```bash
sudo systemctl start cheqd-noded
```
